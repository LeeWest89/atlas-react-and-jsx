      <p>
      My name is Lee West, and I’m from southwest Oklahoma. I am currently in my fifth trimester at Atlas School, where I am focusing on Full-Stack web development. I have developed a strong passion for JavaScript and Python, and I’ve had the opportunity to work on various projects involving these technologies. After graduating, I aim to secure a role in the tech field where I can leverage my skills in programming and problem-solving. I’m particularly interested in roles working on innovative tech solutions. Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy painting and reading. I find that these hobbies not only help me relax but also engage my creative thinking and problem-solving skills.
